| **DATE** | **DIFFICULTY** | **PROBLEM NO:** | **PROBLEM NAME** | **PROBLEM DESCRIPTION** |
|:---------:|:--------------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|:---------:|
| 15/01/24 | [EASY](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/submissions/1146846867) | 1 | **Two Sum** | Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return **indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target**. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. |
| 15/01/24 | [MEDIUM](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/submissions/1146949973) | 167 | **Two Sum II** | Given a **1-indexed array of integers** `numbers` that is already **sorted in non-decreasing order**, find **two numbers such that they add up to a specific target** number. Let these two numbers be `numbers[index1]` and `numbers[index2]` where **`1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length`**. Return the indices of the two numbers, `index1` and `index2`, added by one as an integer array `[index1, index2]` of length 2. |
| 16/01/24 | [MEDIUM](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/submissions/1148014852) | 2 | **Add Two Numbers** | You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.|
| 17/01/24 | [EASY](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/submissions/1148563771) | 9 | **Palindrome Number** | Given an integer **`x`**, return **true** if **`x`** is a palindrome, and **false** otherwise. |
| 17/01/24 | [MEDIUM](https://leetcode.com/problems/multiply-strings/submissions/1148678810) | 43 | **Multiply Strings** | Given two non-negative integers **`num1`** and **`num2`** represented as strings, return the product of **`num1`** and **`num2`**, also represented as a string. |
| 17/01/24 | [HARD](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-missing-positive/submissions/1148747730) | 41 | **First Missing Positive** | Given an unsorted integer array **`nums`**, return the smallest missing positive integer. You must implement an algorithm that runs in **O(n)** time and uses **O(1)** auxiliary space. |
