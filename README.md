|:---------:|:--------------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|:---------:|
| 15/01/24 | [EASY](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/submissions/1146846867) | 1 | **Two Sum** | Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return **indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target**. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. |
| 15/01/24 | [MEDIUM](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/submissions/1146949973) | 167 | **Two Sum II** | Given a **1-indexed array of integers** `numbers` that is already **sorted in non-decreasing order**, find **two numbers such that they add up to a specific target** number. Let these two numbers be `numbers[index1]` and `numbers[index2]` where **`1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length`**. Return the indices of the two numbers, `index1` and `index2`, added by one as an integer array `[index1, index2]` of length 2. |
| 16/01/24 | [MEDIUM](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/submissions/1148014852) | 2 | **Add Two Numbers** | You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.|
| 17/01/24 | [EASY](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/submissions/1148563771) | 9 | **Palindrome Number** | Given an integer **`x`**, return **true** if **`x`** is a palindrome, and **false** otherwise. |
| 17/01/24 | [MEDIUM](https://leetcode.com/problems/multiply-strings/submissions/1148678810) | 43 | **Multiply Strings** | Given two non-negative integers **`num1`** and **`num2`** represented as strings, return the product of **`num1`** and **`num2`**, also represented as a string. |
| 17/01/24 | [HARD](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-missing-positive/submissions/1148747730) | 41 | **First Missing Positive** | Given an unsorted integer array **`nums`**, return the smallest missing positive integer. You must implement an algorithm that runs in **O(n)** time and uses **O(1)** auxiliary space. |
| 18/01/24 | [MEDIUM](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/submissions/1149979914) | 7 | **Reverse Integer** | Given a signed 32-bit integer **`x`**, return **`x`** with its digits reversed.  If reversing **`x`** causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range **[-2<sup>31</sup>, 2<sup>31</sup> - 1]**, then return **0**. |
| 19/01/24 | [MEDIUM](https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-to-roman/submissions/1150471549) | 12 | **Integer to Roman** | Convert given integer **`num`** to Roman numeral. | 
| 19/01/24 | [EASY](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/submissions/1150418959) | 13 | **Roman to Integer** | Convert given Roman numeral **`s`** to integer. | 
| 21/01/24 | [EASY](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/submissions/1152377433) | 20 | **Valid Parantheses** | Given a string **`s`** containing just the characters **'(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']'**, determine if the input string is valid. |
| 25/01/24 | [EASY](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/submissions/1156275936) | 26 | **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array** | Given an integer array **`nums`** sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates **in-place** such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in **`nums`**. |
| 25/01/24 | [EASY](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/submissions/1156301123) | 27 | **Remove Element** | Given an integer array **`nums`** and an integer **`val`**, remove all occurrences of **`val`** in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to **`val`**. |
| <span style="color:orange">26/</span>01<span style="color:green">/24</span> | [EASY](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/submissions/1157280062) | 28 | **First Occurance in String** | Given two strings **`needle`** and **`haystack`**, return the **index of the first occurrence** of **`needle`** in **`haystack`**,  or **-1** if **`needle`** is not part of **`haystack`**. |
| <span style="color:orange">26/</span>01<span style="color:green">/24</span> | [EASY](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/submissions/1157343713) | 35 | **Search Insert Position in Sorted Array** | Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value,  return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order. |
| 27/01/24 | [EASY](https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-last-word/submissions/1158260383) | 58 | **Length of Last Word in a String** | Given a string **`s`** consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string. |
